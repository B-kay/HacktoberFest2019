# HacktoberFest2019
Support open source and make four pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone).

# Introduction to Open Source series.
Before you make your first contribution, you should familiarize yourself with How To Create a Pull Request.

# Participation rules
To qualify for the official limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt, you must register and then make four pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your pull request as invalid or behavior not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 50,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will earn a T-shirt. (Last year 46,088 earned a shirt!)
